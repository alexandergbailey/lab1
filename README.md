# Lab 1: Landing page
## Alex Bailey

### I created a landing page, alexandergbailey.github.io/lab1/, which acts as a sign-up page for a hypothetical lucid-dreaming class. When the screen width is smaller than 920px, the right header options collapse into just one 'sign-in' option, the input and button stack on top of each other while the black opaque backround stretches the width of the screen, and the lists collapse. I modeled this landing page exactly as the example shown in the lab1 description. Images of the full example page and the small-width example page respectively are shown below.

### The layout stage is shown below. This is the setup of the html without CSS.
